1. App Idea

    The idea for our remix of 2048 would be a multiplayer versus version of the game. Players would go up against each other in a fight to get to 2048 first. While going up against each other, random events will happen and will switch the game up (Ex: All block numbers halved, or switch board with opponent). There will be multiple modes with different player counts, for example a 1v1 mode, or a 4 player mode.

2. Target Audience 

    The target audience for our game would be all ages, and would be aimed at people that like challenging, competitive puzzle games.

3. Goals and Vision

    The main goal for our game is to make it competitive and challenging, but also fun and replayable. We want it to be easy to learn but hard to master and have the players keep coming back and trying different strategies to beat their opponents.

4. Key Features

    - Multiplayer battles where whoever gets to 2048 first wins
    - Events: Random events that occur during battles switching up the flow of the game and making the outcome unpredictable.
    - Multiple modes ranging from 2 player battles to large scale battles with 15 players. Special modes also exist that change it from classic 2048. 
    - Currency that players can earn by winning battles that can be spent on skins and colors for the board and blocks on the 2048 board. This would add customization to the game and an incentive to win and play the game.
    - World leaderboard with players with the top battles won.

5. Success Criteria

    The game will be considered successful if it is fun, challenging, and replayable. Replayability being the biggest factor.

6. Technical Requirements

    The game will be developed for mobile devices and PC and will run very smoothly as the game is simplistic and 2D. It will be easy to run on lots of devices making it more accessible. On mobile it will use touch controls and on PC it will use keyboard and mouse controls. It will be cross platform between mobile and PC, allowing even more accessibility and neither platform will have an advantage against each other.
