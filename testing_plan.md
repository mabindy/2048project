# 2048 Royale Game Test Plan

## Part 1: Unit Testing the Game Mechanics

### Description:
Unit testing ensures that individual components of the game, such as player actions and tile mechanics, are functioning correctly. These tests verify the smallest units of the game in isolation to validate their accuracy.

### Action:
- **Basic Mechanics**: Verify if tiles move as expected.
  - Test if pressing the up arrow key moves all tiles upward and correctly merges identical tiles.
  - Ensure tiles that have been moved or merged update their position accordingly.
- **Movement Restrictions**:
  - Ensure that tiles do not move beyond the grid boundary.
  - Verify that tiles do not merge more than once per move.

### Unit Test Examples:
- **Test Case**: Pressing the left arrow key moves tiles left.
  - **Test Data**: Grid contains 2 tiles, each with the value `2`.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Tiles combine into a single tile of value `4` and move to the farthest left position.

- **Test Case**: No movement available for selected key press.
  - **Test Data**: Tiles positioned at boundaries.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Grid remains unchanged.


## Part 2: Logic Testing the Game Rules and Calculations

### Description:
Logic testing verifies the gameâ€™s rules and calculations, including score updates and merging mechanics, to ensure that game elements function correctly in tandem.

### Action:
- **Score Calculation**:
  - Verify if the score increases correctly when tiles merge.
- **Tile Merging**:
  - Ensure merging two tiles results in a new tile with the combined value.
- **Winning Condition**:
  - Verify that the game ends when a player reaches the `2048` tile before their opponent.

### Logic Test Examples:
- **Test Case**: Merging tiles of equal value.
  - **Test Data**: Merge two tiles with values `16` each.
  - **Expected Outcome**: The new tile is valued at `32`, and the score increases by `32` points.

- **Test Case**: Multiple merges in one move.
  - **Test Data**: Four tiles with values `4`, `4`, `8`, and `8`.
  - **Expected Outcome**: After moving left, resulting tiles are `8` and `16`, and score is updated accordingly.

- **Test Case**: Player reaches the `2048` tile.
  - **Test Data**: Player merges tiles until a `2048` tile is created.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Player wins the game, and the opponent(s) is/are notified of their loss.


## Part 3: Boundary Testing: Edge Cases and Limits

### Description:
Boundary testing checks how the game handles extreme situations, such as maximum and minimum tile values and reaching the grid limits.

### Action:
- **Max Tile Value**:
  - Verify the behavior when reaching the maximum tile value possible.
- **Full Grid**:
  - Ensure that the game ends properly when no moves are possible.
- **Opponent Interaction**:
  - Verify that the opponent is notified when a player reaches the `2048` tile.

### Boundary Test Examples:
- **Test Case**: Reaching the maximum tile value.
  - **Test Data**: Continue merging until a tile of value `2048` is reached.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Player receives a "Victory" message and is awarded with coins. Opponent is notified of their loss.

- **Test Case**: Full grid with no available moves.
  - **Test Data**: The grid is fully populated with tiles of different values.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Game ends and "You lose!" message is displayed.


## Part 4: Integration Testing: System Interaction

### Description:
Integration testing ensures that different parts of the game (e.g., user interface, scoring system, tile movement) work seamlessly together.

### Action:
- **Gameplay and Scoring**:
  - Verify if the score updates correctly after every move.
- **Movement and UI Interaction**:
  - Ensure the movement is reflected visually in the game grid.
- **Player vs Opponent**:
  - Ensure that the game correctly tracks both players' progress and declares the winner appropriately.

### Integration Test Examples:
- **Test Case**: Merging tiles and score update.
  - **Test Data**: User moves a tile to merge two tiles of value `64`.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Score is updated, and merged tile of value `128` is displayed.

- **Test Case**: Undo functionality.
  - **Test Data**: User performs a move and then undoes it.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Grid returns to the previous state before the move.

- **Test Case**: Player wins against opponent.
  - **Test Data**: Player reaches the `2048` tile before the opponent.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Player is declared the winner, and the opponent is notified of their loss.


## Part 5: Handling Bad Input and Run-Time Errors

### Description:
Testing for bad input and run-time errors helps ensure that the game can handle unexpected actions without crashing.

### Action:
- **Invalid User Input**:
  - Verify that invalid key presses are ignored.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Ensure that the game state remains consistent in case of unexpected errors.
- **Opponent Disconnection**:
  - Verify that the game handles opponent disconnection gracefully.

### Bad Input Test Examples:
- **Test Case**: Pressing an unsupported key (e.g., `X`).
  - **Test Data**: Press the `X` key.
  - **Expected Outcome**: No change to the game grid.

- **Test Case**: Saving during an error.
  - **Test Data**: Attempt to save the game while tiles are still moving.
  - **Expected Outcome**: The game displays a "Save failed" message and remains stable.

- **Test Case**: Opponent disconnects during the game.
  - **Test Data**: Opponent disconnects while the player is making a move.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Player is notified, and the game ends.
